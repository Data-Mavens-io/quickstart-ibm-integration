The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans one or three Availability Zones.*

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS. *

* In the public subnets:

	** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*

	** A boot node Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that also serves as a bastion host to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in private subnets.

* In the private subnets:

	** OCP master instances up to three Availability Zones

	** OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) compute nodes that host the Cloud Pak for Integration capabilities

	** Elastic Block Storage disks that are mounted on the compute nodes for container persistent data

* A Classic Load Balancer spanning the public subnets for accessing Cloud Pak for Integration from a web browser.

* A Classic Load Balancer spanning the public subnets for accessing the OCS S3 service.

* A Classic Load Balancer spanning the public subnets for accessing the OCS Nooba service.

* A Network Load Balancer spanning the public subnets for routing external OpenShift application programming interface (API) traffic to the OCP master instances.

* A Network Load Balancer spanning the private subnets for routing internal OpenShift application programming interface (API) traffic to the OCP master instances.

* Amazon Route 53 as your public Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving domain names of the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration management console and applications deployed on the cluster.

**NOTE:** The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.

The Cloud Pak for Integration components run as containers on the OpenShift compute nodes, and build on a range of common platform and operational services that underpin all IBM Cloud Paks.
