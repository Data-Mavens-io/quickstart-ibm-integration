== Troubleshooting

*Q.* I encountered a CREATE_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state will be retained and the instance will be left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (Look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

*Important* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you will continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation].

*Q.* I am not able to delete the stack that I created from the Quick Start.

*A.* We recommend that you clean up the registry bucket in your S3 account and retry deleting the stack.

*Q.* OpenShift shows not enough resources when installing capabilities or runtimes.

*A.* When installing capabilities or runtimes it might happen that the capability or runtime (e.g. Event Streams) stays in Pending state because not all the pods are coming up. This is often due to not enough resources being available, so the Kubernetes scheduler cannot place the pods. To check if that is the case open the OpenShift admin console and navigate to Events as shown in the following.

This can be resolved by either uninstalling not needed capabilities and runtimes or by adding more worker nodes to the cluster until the resource requirements are fulfilled.

*Q.* OpenShift shows pods on pending status for excessive period of time.

*A.* If the installation is still in Pending after a long time or is in status Failed it might be that the cluster was not yet ready or there was another temporary error.

This can be resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the capability or runtime.

Make sure to check if the configuration is correct before reinstalling.

If reinstalling does not solve it here are some places for debugging:

* OpenShift provides a list of events in the admin console, therefore go to Home -> Events and select the namespace the capabilities and runtimes are installed in
* In case a pod is failing check the logs of the pod by going to the admin console and open Workloads -> Pods and then search for the failing pod and click on it. Then select Logs to view the logs or Events to view the events related to that pod

If all this fails, please contact your IBM representative.
