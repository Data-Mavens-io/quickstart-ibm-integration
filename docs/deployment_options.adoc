== Deployment options

This Quick Start provides the following deployment options:

* *Deploy Cloud Pak for Integration into a new VPC* (end-to-end deployment). This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components, and then deploys Cloud Pak for Integrations into this new VPC.

*Deploy Cloud Pak for Integration into an existing VPC*. This option provisions Cloud Pak for Integrations in your existing VPC infrastructure.

The Quick Start also lets you configure CIDR blocks, instance types, and Cloud Pak for Integration settings, as discussed later in this guide.
